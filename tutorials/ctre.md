# Using the CTRE Libraries
For 2017, the CTRE Libraries, including CAN Talon, have been removed from the base install. This change has been made to match upstream WPILib. 
Instead, the CTRE Libraries are provided in a separate NuGet package, which can be found at [https://www.nuget.org/packages/FRC.WPILib.CTRE/](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FRC.WPILib.CTRE/).

Currently this only includes the CANTalon functionality, however we hope to add support the new Pigeon IMU soon.
